"""
Comprehensive tests for migration rollback safety.

These tests verify that the ISIN nullable migrations are safe to rollback:
1. Test upgrade works correctly (make ISIN nullable)
2. Test downgrade fails gracefully with NULL values present
3. Test downgrade succeeds when no NULL values exist
4. Verify helpful error messages for users
5. Test both transactions and positions tables
