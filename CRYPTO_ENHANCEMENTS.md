# Cryptocurrency Price Fetching Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the existing `PriceFetcher` service to provide comprehensive cryptocurrency support through CoinGecko API with improved reliability, error handling, and additional features.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Expanded Cryptocurrency Support
- **Before**: Limited to 15 basic crypto symbols
- **After**: Support for 60+ cryptocurrencies including:
  - Major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, etc.)
  - DeFi tokens (UNI, AAVE, COMP, YFI, etc.)
  - Layer 2 solutions (ARB, OP, MANTLE, etc.)
  - Gaming & NFT tokens (AXS, SAND, MANA, etc.)
  - Privacy coins (XMR, ZEC, DASH)
  - Exchange tokens (FTT, CRO, KCS, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Price Data Quality
- **OHLCV Data**: Improved OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data fetching for cryptocurrencies
- **Multi-currency Support**: Fetch prices in both EUR and USD
- **24-hour Metrics**: Include 24h volume, change, and market cap data
- **Volume Data**: Better volume data integration from CoinGecko APIs

### 3. Robust Error Handling & Rate Limiting
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Proper handling of HTTP 429 (rate limit exceeded)
- **Dynamic Rate Limiting**: Adjusts delays based on API key presence
  - Free tier: 1.5s between requests
  - Premium tier: 0.5s between requests
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for different endpoint types
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if optional features fail

### 4. Real-time Price Caching
- **Unified Interface**: Single method for both stocks and crypto real-time prices
- **30-second Cache**: Reduces API calls while maintaining freshness
- **Enhanced Data**: Include additional crypto-specific metrics (24h volume, market cap)
- **Source Attribution**: Clear indication of data source (yahoo vs coingecko)

### 5. New Features

#### Crypto-to-Crypto Conversion Rates
```python
# Get BTC/ETH conversion rate
conversion_rate = await fetcher.fetch_crypto_conversion_rate("BTC", "ETH", "USD")
# Returns: 1 BTC = X ETH
```

#### Enhanced Historical Data
- **Volume Integration**: Historical price data now includes trading volumes
- **OHLC Enhancement**: Attempts to fetch true OHLC data for recent periods
- **Currency Support**: Historical data available in both EUR and USD

#### Better Currency Support
- **Multi-currency**: Fetch crypto prices in EUR, USD, and other supported currencies
- **FX Integration**: Seamless integration with existing FX rate fetching

## Configuration

### API Key Setup (Optional but Recommended)
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Benefits of API key:
- Higher rate limits (up to 500 calls/minute vs 50 for free tier)
- Access to additional endpoints and features
- More reliable service during high-demand periods

## Usage Examples

### Basic Crypto Price Fetching
```python
from app.services.price_fetcher import PriceFetcher

fetcher = PriceFetcher()

# Get current BTC price in EUR
price_data = await fetcher.fetch_crypto_price("BTC", "EUR")
print(f"BTC: {price_data['close']} EUR (24h change: {price_data['change_24h']}%)")

# Get historical prices
from datetime import date, timedelta
end_date = date.today()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

historical = await fetcher.fetch_historical_prices(
    "ETH", start_date, end_date, is_crypto=True
)
```

### Real-time Price Fetching (Unified Interface)
```python
# Works for both stocks and cryptocurrencies
btc_price = fetcher.fetch_realtime_price("BTC")  # Crypto
aapl_price = fetcher.fetch_realtime_price("AAPL")  # Stock
```

### Crypto Conversion Rates
```python
# Convert between cryptocurrencies
btc_eth_rate = await fetcher.fetch_crypto_conversion_rate("BTC", "ETH")
print(f"1 BTC = {btc_eth_rate} ETH")
```

## API Rate Limits

### Free Tier
- **Rate Limit**: ~50 calls/minute
- **Features**: Basic price data, limited historical data
- **Delay**: 1.5 seconds between requests

### Premium Tier (with API key)
- **Rate Limit**: Up to 500 calls/minute
- **Features**: Enhanced data, more endpoints, better reliability
- **Delay**: 0.5 seconds between requests

## Error Handling

The enhanced service includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect 429 responses and retry after delay
- **Data Validation**: Validate API responses before processing
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Continue operation when non-critical features fail

## Testing

A comprehensive test script is provided at `test_crypto_prices.py`:
```bash
python3 test_crypto_prices.py
```

This script tests:
- Crypto ticker detection
- Price fetching in multiple currencies
- Historical data retrieval
- Real-time price fetching
- Crypto conversion rates

## Integration with Existing Systems

The enhanced service maintains full backward compatibility:
- All existing methods continue to work unchanged
- Automatic crypto detection based on ticker symbols
- Seamless integration with existing price update tasks
- Consistent data format across all asset types

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
1. **Additional Exchanges**: Support for Binance, Kraken, etc.
2. **DeFi Protocols**: Direct integration with DeFi protocols for pricing
3. **WebSocket Support**: Real-time price updates via WebSocket connections
4. **Portfolio Analytics**: Enhanced crypto-specific portfolio metrics
5. **Tax Reporting**: Crypto-specific tax calculation features

## Files Modified

- `backend/app/services/price_fetcher.py` - Main enhancements
- `backend/app/config.py` - Already had CoinGecko API key support
- `backend/app/tasks/price_updates.py` - No changes needed (uses existing interface)

The enhancements provide a robust, comprehensive cryptocurrency price fetching system that integrates seamlessly with the existing portfolio tracking infrastructure.
